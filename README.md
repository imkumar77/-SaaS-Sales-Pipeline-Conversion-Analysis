# -SaaS-Sales-Pipeline-Conversion-Analysis
The sales pipeline conversion percentage at TechnoServe (a tech SaaS startup) has dropped from 35% at the end of last fiscal (FY 2017-18) to 25% at present.

## Business Problem:
- Case study on TechnoServe, a fictitious Tech SaaS (software as a service) startup that specialises in offering various software services to small and medium enterprise customers. The products offered by the company are geared towards increasing productivity for its customers. Its software solutions are customised based on the customers’ needs and on how much they are willing to spend on a product.

- As TechnoServe is a SaaS provider, its revenue is highly dependent on the number of clients it has. However, the company is facing a pertinent problem that is prevalent in the IT industry today: declining conversions across its sales funnel. This means the company is failing to convert its potential customers into clients.

## Objective
- The objective of this project is to understand why TechnoServe is experiencing a decline in sales conversions and identify the key factors affecting the movement of leads through its sales funnel. The goal is to analyse customer segments, product fit, lead quality, and sales performance to uncover the root causes of low conversion rates, and recommend actions that can help improve client acquisition and revenue growth.
