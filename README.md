# -SaaS-Sales-Pipeline-Conversion-Analysis
The sales pipeline conversion percentage at TechnoServe (a tech SaaS startup) has dropped from 35% at the end of last fiscal (FY 2017-18) to 25% at present.

## About Company
- The company is located in Pune; it started its operations in 2010.
- It has clients in Pune as well as other cities.
- It has more than 600 employees distributed across multiple teams.
- It offers a wide variety of IT solutions spanning different industries

## Business Problem:
- Case study on TechnoServe, a fictitious Tech SaaS (software as a service) startup that specialises in offering various software services to small and medium enterprise customers. The products offered by the company are geared towards increasing productivity for its customers. Its software solutions are customised based on the customers’ needs and on how much they are willing to spend on a product.

- As TechnoServe is a SaaS provider, its revenue is highly dependent on the number of clients it has. However, the company is facing a pertinent problem that is prevalent in the IT industry today: declining conversions across its sales funnel. This means the company is failing to convert its potential customers into clients.

## Objective
- The objective of this project is to understand why TechnoServe is experiencing a decline in sales conversions and identify the key factors affecting the movement of leads through its sales funnel. The goal is to analyse customer segments, product fit, lead quality, and sales performance to uncover the root causes of low conversion rates, and recommend actions that can help improve client acquisition and revenue growth.

### Corresponding Insights
- We are losing 78 percent of our leads, and only 22 percent are converting. This is a significant gap, and it highlights the need to train the sales team.
- We also have a higher number of customers interested in ERP implementation. But our product is not as much good as our compititors
- Mumbai and Delhi are the markets from which we receive the highest number of leads. This indicates that these two cities have the strongest potential to generate revenue for the company.
- Marketing and enterprise sellers are contributing 93 percent of the total leads, making them the strongest lead sources for the business.
- The main cause of the drop from 35 percent to 25 percent is that management is not ready to invest in innovation or after-sales service. They are also not investing in strengthening the brand image.

### Recommendations
- Management should increase investment in marketing and enterprise sales.
- It is also important to hire more tech-savvy professionals with experience in ERP systems.
- The sales team requires structured training. They should be provided with a clear template and a well-prepared sales pitch.
- The system needs timely upgrades.Additionally, greater focus on the Mumbai and Delhi markets is recommended, as these locations generate the highest number of conversions.
